## File Descriptions

### DownladBLSData.R

Some of the BLS data files are large enough that it is impractical to work with
them over the net. This R script downloads any that are missing from the target
directory.

### BLSDataExporation.Rmd

This loads the BLS data and displays for each file the data structure, summary, head, and tail as BLSDataExploration.html.
